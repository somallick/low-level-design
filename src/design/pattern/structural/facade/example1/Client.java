* Letâ€™s consider a hotel. This hotel has a hotel keeper.
* There are a lot of restaurants inside the hotel e.g. Veg restaurants, Non-Veg restaurants, and Veg/Non Both restaurants.
* You, as a client want access to different menus of different restaurants.
* You do not know what are the different menus they have. You just have access to a hotel keeper who knows his hotel well.
* Whichever menu you want, you tell the hotel keeper, and he takes it out of the respective restaurants and hands it over to you.
